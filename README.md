## Directory Structure
### / (root)
This is where you find the main files for the game, including Main.py (suprise, suprise),
Scene.py (The thing that allows you to load scenes in .json format), and Group.py.

### /assets
This is where all the sounds and images for the game are. I made the music with [Soundation](https://soundation.com/)

### /objects
Where all the in-game objects are. This includes Walls, players and text.
